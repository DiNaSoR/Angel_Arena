# Angel Arena
Alpha v1.0

Angel Arena map is a remake of Angel Arena from WC3. there is 2 Teams Angels and Demons, you pick which one you would like to play with and fight your way to the top ranks to win the game, the game now is under heavy developments you might found bugs and stupid stuff please don't hesitate to report them. 


For now the UI is not far from ready the default value to win is 50 kills by Team, the speciality about this adventure is to find secret, hiding places and powerful items. 


Please enjoy it and share it
